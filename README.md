Howdy, I'm Maxie or "Ouija"

I'm currently exploring different hobbies and fields so this GitHub is a personal exploration one.

Some things about me:
- I'm nonbinary so they/them is preferred, masc termology is acceptable
- Languages I'm learning: Java, Python, HTML/CSS
- I'm heavily into video games and horror media. (my favorite game as of right now is Silent Hill 2)
- I'm a Computer Science Major, and a Dr. Pepper addict. Yes those two things belong in the same sentence.
