Howdy, I'm Maxie

I'm currently exploring different hobbies and fields so this GitHub is a personal exploration one.

Some things about me:
- I'm nonbinary so they/them is preferred, masc termology is acceptable
- Currently learning Python
- I'm heavily into video games and horror media. (My favorite game as of right now is Silent Hill 2)
- I'm a Computer Science Major, looking towards freelance IT and future game developer.

I have a few projects in mind I would like to develop and progress in that I will likely list elsewhere.
What do I use:
- PyCharm Community Edition
- Python
- MySQL & PgAdmin
